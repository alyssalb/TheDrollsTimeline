      <h2>1558 – Elizabeth I is Crowned</h2>
      <p>Start of the Elizabethan era, a time of great patronage and support for the arts. Theatre flourished with royal and noble support both monetarily and affectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1576">
      <h2>1576 – <i>The Theatre</i> Opens in Shoreditch</h2>
      <p>The first permanent purpose-built public playhouse in London opens, built by James Burbage (who was known for his reputation as an early actor and theatre builder and owner in England; he is also the father of Richard Burbage, who played most of the leading roles at The Globe and was one of the most famous actors in his time). This launched a new era of professional acting companies and single-purpose venues built for performance work. 
        </p>
      <p>Fun-fact: The Theatre was dismantled, its materials used to construct <i>The Globe</i> in 1599. </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="entry" id="1587">
      <h2>1587-1599 - The Rise of Major Theatres</h2>
      <p>This timeframe sees the building of <i>The Rose</i> (1587), <i>The Swan</i> (1595) and <i>The Globe</i> (1599). Shakespeare’s company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, perform at <i>The Globe</i>. </p>
      <p>Audiences are mixed-class for public theatres, offering varied types of spectacle for lower class society members - historical records exist that documented attendees in various professions such as “cobbler, weaver, baker, tailor, bodice-maker, joiner, clerk, apprentice, along with their women-folk and maidservants, as well as prostitutes and ‘companions’” (Capp 2003, 168). Private theatres exist for elite audiences, such as nobles and royals. 
         </p>

    <section class="entry" id="1590">
      <h2>1590s - 1610s - Golden Age of Elizabethan/Jacobean Drama</h2>
      <p>Popular playwrights include big names such as: 
          <ul>
            <li>William Shakespeare (<i>Hamlet, The Tempest, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear, etc.</i>).</li>
            <li>Christopher Marlowe (<i>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, The Jew of Malta, Tamurlaine</i> (the most famous early play written in blank verse, the unrhymed iambic pentameter popularized by Shakespeare)).</li>
            <li>Ben Jonson (<i>Every Man In His Humour, The Alechemist, Bartholowmew Fair</i>).</li>
            <li>Thomas Kyd (<i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, the first revenge tragedy in English literature).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <p>Known genres that are hallmarks of the time are developed and expanded - of course comedy and tragedy, but more particularly histories (which The Drolls would arguably fall into, with its emphasis on readapting and recontextualizing a historical event with added comedy and drama/tragedy), revenge tragedies (established by Kyd’s <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>), and romantic comedies (Shakespeare's <i>Much Ado About Nothing, The Taming of the Shrew, etc.</i>).</p>
      <p>There was much interest in the personal and political lives of artists at this time - they were well supported, but also actors have for a long time been associated with other “unsavory” or illicit professions, and the audiences were likely populated with a population of citizens that would have included some not-insignificant portion of sex workers, pick pockets, and other risk-associated characters. This led to things like speculation about Christopher Marlowe (who was an extreme political and anti-authoritary writer) being an atheist, queer man, and a spy for the crown, among others. Interestingly, these rumours may have included some truth.

    <section class="entry" id="1603">
      <h2>1603 - Death of Elizabeth I and Crowning of James I</h2>
      <p>Theatre companies are rebranded as needed for the change in royalty. For example, <i>The Globe</i>'s Lord Chamberlain's Men became the King's Men under James I.</p>
      <p>Drama leans darker, with more violence desired by audiences.</p>
      <p>Court masques gain more popularity, led by the courtly enjoyment of Ben Jonson’s Masques. Visual and musical spectacles, often but not always with religious allegory in play. The court masques would live on in a disfigured formation in the later Puritan rule that our play is set in.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1616">
      <h2>1616 - Shakespeare Dies</h2>
        <p>The symbolic end of the Elizabethan “Golden Age” of art, theatre, and literature. Arts become more privatized and less public, focus is placed on heavily stylized and court-centric forms of performance. Performance is more for the royals, though public performances still exist. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1625">
        <h2>1625 - Crowning of Charles I</h2>
          <p>Charles I loved the arts, including theatre. His queen (Henrietta) is a french catholic, and as such French and Italian art styles and influence creep into visual and performing arts of this time period. Court masques become even more elaborate and ornamental, moving further from the public. This is to say, the royal camp was not innocent in the rise of Oliver Cromwell and the Puritans - they pulled further away from the unrestful public by further privatizing (or royalizing?) the arts. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1642">
      <h2>1642 - Official Puritan Parliament and Closure of the Theatres</h2>
        <p>The start of the English Civil War between the monarchy/royalists and the puritans. 
          </p>
        <p>Theatres are considered sites of immorality, and must be closed for public good. Performances are banned and so is poetry, music, art, even public rhyming. Many playhouses are dismantled.
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1649">
      <h2>1649 - Charles I is Beheaded</h2>
        <p><b>A note on beheading:</b> While this seems horrific and barbaric to us, beheading (especially if granted a sharp sword) was considered a relatively humane execution method at the time. This was way more respectful and less painful/drawn out than other popular methods such being hung, drawn and quartered, or broken on the wheel. 
          </p>
        <p>The Commonwealth, or the Interregnum (literally “between reigns” or between Charles I and Charles II), lasting from 1649-1660 when the monarchy was restored, begins. Puritan rule was established in England under Oliver Cromwell. 
          </p>
        <p>Cromwell’s government employs mass censorship and suppression of public entertainment, including theatre, visual arts, and dancing. Of course, like all good dictators, he allowed private and court performances of things he enjoyed, like an opera with minimal performance aspects aside from the music/singing. These were enforced and limited to his approval, which was sparse. 
          </p>
        <p>Artists moved underground, and performances persisted in this time. Also popular were closet dramas (just for reading, not performing), and theatre lived on in the power of print during this time (in secret, distributed with care). 
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1650">
      <h2>1650s - Continued Suppression, Continued Quiet Rebellion</h2>
        <p>People still need and want art, and artists have to do what they are able to make a living and create. Art, especially performance like theatre and dance, exist in private at taverns and inns when available, in secret and street guerrilla performance like our Drolls, and in print. Seditious playwrights continue writing closest dramas for private consumption. 
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1658">
      <h2>1658 - Oliver Cromwell Dies</h2>
        <p>The Puritans’ ruler dies and they lose grip on the “commonwealth” they have established. Their parliament dissolved in 1659, paving the way for restoring the old parliament and the monarchy the following year. 
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1660">
      <h2>1660 - Restoration, King Charles II Ascends</h2>
        <p>Theaters are reopened - FINALLY! Charles II gives 2 companies licenses to perform - The King’s Company and the Duke’s Company. The latter is handled by Sir WIlliam Davenant, who begins in earnest to revive Shakespeare’s work. Ironically, the King’s Company was thought to get all the “good” plays of the time, which did not include the obscure work of Shakespeare, which was held by Davenant and preserved in this way. We may not have known about him at all if it weren’t for Davenant and his Duke’s Company reviving and, importantly, printing his work.
          </p>
        <p>Restoration drama allowed women to perform onstage. Genre popularity shifted with this addition, and new work was dominated by comedies of manners.           
          </p>
        <p>Proscenium stages were introduced and grew in popularity. Restoration theatre practices established a tradition that leads to our modern single-purpose venue private theaters, moving from the public houses of the past.
