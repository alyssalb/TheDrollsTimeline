      <h2>1558 – Elizabeth I is Crowned</h2>
      <p>Start of the Elizabethan era, a time of great patronage and support for the arts. Theatre flourished with royal and noble support both monetarily and affectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1576">
      <h2>1576 – <i>The Theatre</i> Opens in Shoreditch</h2>
      <p>The first permanent purpose-built public playhouse in London opens, built by James Burbage (who was known for his reputation as an early actor and theatre builder and owner in England; he is also the father of Richard Burbage, who played most of the leading roles at <i>The Globe</i> and was one of the most famous actors in his time). This launched a new era of professional acting companies and single-purpose venues built for performance work. 
        </p>
      <p>Fun-fact: <i>The Theatre</i> was dismantled, its materials used to construct <i>The Globe</i> in 1599. </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="entry" id="1587">
      <h2>1587-1599 - The Rise of Major Theatres</h2>
      <p>This timeframe sees the building of <i>The Rose</i> (1587), <i>The Swan</i> (1595) and <i>The Globe</i> (1599). Shakespeare’s company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, perform at <i>The Globe</i>. 
        </p>
      <p>Audiences are mixed-class for public theatres, offering varied types of spectacle for lower class society members - historical records exist that documented attendees in various professions such as “cobbler, weaver, baker, tailor, bodice-maker, joiner, clerk, apprentice, along with their women-folk and maidservants, as well as prostitutes and ‘companions’” <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0268117X.2003.10555524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Capp 2003, 168)</a>. Private theatres exist for elite audiences, such as nobles and royals.

      <h2>1590s - 1610s - Golden Age of Elizabethan/Jacobean Drama</h2>
      <p>Popular playwrights include big names such as: 
          <ul>
            <li>William Shakespeare (<i>Hamlet, The Tempest, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear, etc.</i>).</li>
            <li>Christopher Marlowe <a href="images/Christopher_Marlowe wikii pic.jpg" class="lightbox">
                          <img src="images/Christopher_Marlowe wikii pic.jpg" alt="Image of Kit Marlowe" style="max-width: 20px;" />
                          </a>
                  (<i>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, The Jew of Malta, Tamurlaine</i> (the most famous early play written in <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The unrhymed iambic pentameter popularized by Shakespeare.">blank verse</span>)).</li>
            <li>Ben Jonson <a href="images/Benjamin_Jonson wiki pic.jpg" class="lightbox">
                          <img src="images/Benjamin_Jonson wiki pic.jpg" alt="Image of Ben Jonson" style="max-width: 20px;" />
                           </a>
                  (<i>Every Man In His Humour, The Alechemist, Bartholowmew Fair</i>).</li>
            <li>Thomas Kyd (<i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, the first <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A tragedic story focusing on ill-fated pursuit of revenge, where both parties often suffer violence and death">revenge tragedy in English literature</span>).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <p>Known genres that are hallmarks of the time are developed and expanded - of course comedy and tragedy, but more particularly histories (which The Drolls would arguably fall into, with its emphasis on readapting and recontextualizing a historical event with added comedy and drama/tragedy), revenge tragedies (established by Kyd’s <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>), and romantic comedies (Shakespeare's <i>Much Ado About Nothing, The Taming of the Shrew, etc.</i>).</p>
      <p>There was much interest in the personal and political lives of artists at this time - they were well supported, but also actors have for a long time been associated with other “unsavory” or illicit professions, and the audiences were likely populated with a population of citizens that would have included some not-insignificant portion of sex workers, pick-pockets, and other risk-associated characters. This led to things like speculation about Christopher Marlowe (whose writing often dealt with political and anti-authoritarian themes) being an atheist, queer man, and a spy for the crown, among others. The nature of these rumours is <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=mqr;c=mqr;c=mqrarchive;idno=act2080.0042.306;g=mqrg;rgn=main;view=text;xc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complicated</a>.

    <section class="entry" id="1603">
      <h2>1603 - Death of Elizabeth I and Crowning of James I</h2>
      <p>Theatre companies are rebranded as needed for the change in royalty. For example, <i>The Globe</i>'s Lord Chamberlain's Men became the King's Men under James I.</p>
      <p>Drama leans darker, with more violence desired by audiences.</p>

      <h2>1616 - Shakespeare Dies</h2>
        <p>The symbolic end of the Elizabethan <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z28vdmn/revision/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Golden Age”</a> of art, theatre, and literature. This era saw the beginnings of privatized theatre, and additional focus was placed on heavily stylized and court-centric forms of performance. Private performances were available to royals and nobles, though public performances remained popular and well-attended. </p>

    <section class="entry" id="1625">
        <h2>1625 - Crowning of Charles I</h2>
          <p><a href="https://youtu.be/899il5aiTBg?si=fUZXgPHzFuLyO07Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles I</a> loved the arts, including theatre. His queen (Henrietta) was a french catholic, and as such French and Italian art styles and influence creep into the visual and performing arts of this time period. Court masques become even more elaborate and ornamental, moving further from the public. This is to say, the royal camp was not innocent in the rise of Oliver Cromwell and the Puritans - they pulled further away from the unrestful public by further privatizing (or royalizing?) the arts. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1642">
      <h2>1642 - Official Puritan Parliament and Closure of the Theatres</h2>
        <p>The start of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English Civil War</a> between the monarchy/royalists and the parliamentarians/puritans. The monarchy had grown increasingly unpopular due to Charles I's governing style (best described as "I make up all the rules and then none of them apply to me so I do whatever I want").
          </p>
        <p>Theatres are considered sites of immorality, and must be <a href="https://www.folger.edu/blogs/collation/minding-the-gaps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closed</a> for public good. Performances are banned and so is poetry, music, art, even public rhyming. Many playhouses are dismantled.
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1649">
      <h2>1649 - Charles I is Beheaded</h2>
        <p>The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The Commonwealth is the time of Oliver Cromwell's rule of Britain without the monarchy. The Interregnum is also used to refer to this period, and means 'between reigns' or between Charles I and Charles II">Commonwealth, or the Interregnum</span>, lasting from 1649-1660 when the monarchy was restored, begins. Puritan rule was established in England under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ1yPz14LrU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Cromwell</a>.
          </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/oliver-cromwell-and-family" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cromwell</a>’s government employs mass censorship and suppression of public entertainment, including theatre, visual arts, and dancing. Of course, like all good hypocritical dictators, he allowed private and court performances of things he enjoyed, particularly musically-oriented work such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/feb/16/artsandhumanities.highereducation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">operas</a> and selections of visual art. These were enforced and limited to his approval, which was sparse. 
          </p>
        <p>Artists moved underground, and performances persisted in this time. Also popular were <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Plays written as a piece of theatre but meant to be read privately instead of performed">closet dramas</span>, and theatre lived on in the power of print during this time (in secret, distributed with care). 
          </p>
        <p><b>A note on beheading:</b> While this seems horrific and barbaric to us, beheading (especially if granted a sharp sword) was considered a relatively humane execution method at the time. This was more respectful and less painful/drawn out than <a href="https://www.history.co.uk/articles/that-takes-guts-7-gory-execution-methods-from-tudor-england" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other popular methods</a> such being hung, drawn and quartered, or broken on the wheel. 
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1650">
      <h2>1650s - Continued Suppression, Continued Quiet Rebellion</h2>
        <p>People still need and want art, and artists have to do what they are able to make a living and create. Art, especially performance like theatre and dance, exist in private at taverns and inns when available, in secret and street guerrilla performance like our Drolls, and in print. Seditious playwrights continue writing closest dramas for private consumption. 
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1658">
      <h2>1658 - Oliver Cromwell Dies</h2>
        <p>The Puritans’ ruler <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j8vn2ne70o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dies</a> and they lose grip on the “commonwealth” they have established. Their parliament dissolved in 1659, paving the way for restoring the old parliament and the monarchy the following year. 
          </p>
    </section>

    <section class="entry" id="1660">
      <h2>1660 - Restoration, King Charles II Ascends</h2>
        <p>Theaters are reopened - FINALLY! Charles II gives 2 companies licenses to perform - The King’s Company and <a href="https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/258059779/Sir_William_Davenant_and_the_Duke_s_Company.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Duke’s Company</a>. The latter is handled by Sir William Davenant, who begins in earnest to revive Shakespeare’s work. Ironically, the King’s Company was thought to get all the “good” plays of the time, which did not include the obscure work of Shakespeare, luckily preserved and held by Davenant. We may not have known about him at all if it weren’t for Davenant and his Duke’s Company reviving and, importantly, printing his work.
          </p>
        <p>Restoration drama allowed women to write plays and even perform onstage. Genre popularity shifted with this addition, and new work was dominated by <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A genre that presents social customs and behaviours in a comedic way. Often focuses on upper class characters, emphasis on dialogue and wit.">comedies of manners</span>.           
          </p>
        <p>Proscenium stages were introduced and grew in popularity. Restoration theatre practices established a tradition that leads to our modern single-purpose venue private theaters, moving from the public houses of the past.
